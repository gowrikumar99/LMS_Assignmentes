/*

Basic Set Operations:
Create a HashSet and add the following elements to it: "apple," "banana," "cherry," "date," "fig."
Print the elements in the set.
Check if the set contains "banana."
Remove "cherry" from the set.
Print the size of the set.

Removing Duplicates:
Given an array of integers, write a Java program to convert it into a Set to remove duplicates.
Convert the Set back to an array and print the unique values.

Set Operations:
Create two sets: set1 and set2, and add some elements to each.
Find and print the union of the two sets.
Find and print the intersection of the two sets.
Find and print the elements that are unique to each set (i.e., not in the other set).

Set of Custom Objects:
Create a class called Person with attributes such as name and age.
Create a HashSet of Person objects and add several Person objects to it.
Check if the set contains a specific Person based on their attributes (e.g., name and age).

Set Iteration:
Create a HashSet of country names.
Use an iterator to loop through the set and print each country name.
Modify the loop to print the countries in reverse order.

Set Conversion:
Create an ArrayList of integers.
Convert the ArrayList to a HashSet to remove duplicates.
Convert the HashSet back to an ArrayList.

Set Operations with User Input:
Write a program that allows a user to input a list of numbers.
Create a HashSet to store the unique numbers.
Ask the user if they want to add more numbers or perform operations like checking for containment or finding the size of the set.
